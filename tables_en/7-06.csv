"level0","","","Level 0","Physical information: Reconstructed unprocessed instrument data at full space time resolution with all available supplemental information to be used in subsequent processing (e.g., ephemeris, health and safety) appended."
"level1","","","Level I","Physical information: Unpacked, reformatted level 0 data, with all supplemental information to be used in subsequent processing appended. Optional radiometric and geometric correction applied to produce parameters in physical units. Data generally presented as full time/space resolution. A wide variety of sub level products are possible."
"level2","","","Level II","Geophysical information. Retrieved environmental variables (e.g., ocean wave height, soil moisture, ice concentration) at the same resolution and location as the level 1 source data."
"level3","","","Level III","Geophysical information. Data or retrieved environmental variables which have been spatially and/or temporally re-sampled (i.e., derived from level 1 or 2 products). Such re-sampling may include averaging and compositing."
"level4","","","Level IV","Thematic information. Model output or results from analyses of lower level data (i.e., variables that are not directly measured by the instruments, but are derived from these measurements)."
"raw","","","Raw","Physical information: Data in their original packets, as received from a satellite"
"unknown","","","(unknown)",NA
